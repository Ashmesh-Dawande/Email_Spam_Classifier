# EmailSpamClassifier
This repository houses an Email Spam Classifier that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and different machine learning models to identify whether an email is spam or legitimate. The classifier has been trained on a comprehensive dataset and demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and ham emails. And I deployed it using Streamlit app.
