It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using different machine learning  algorithms and deep learning . The model is evaluated on a testing/validation set to measure its performance. Once trained, the classifier can automatically filter out spam emails from incoming messages.This classifier is not that accurate but is reliable.'
